## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **desktop-first animated website** that focuses on smooth scrolling, motion-driven interactions, and creative visual effects rather than responsiveness.

The main highlight of this project is a **custom eye animation** where the pupils dynamically follow the user's mouse movement, creating a highly engaging and interactive experience.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎢 **Smooth Scrolling** using **Locomotive Scroll**
- 🎬 **Advanced Animations** powered by **Framer Motion**
- 👀 **Interactive Eye Animation**  
  → Pupils track the user's mouse movement in real time
- 🎨 Modern UI inspired by **Ochi.design**
- 🖥️ Desktop-first layout (⚠️ *Not responsive*)

---

## 🧠 Unique Interaction

### 👁 Eye-Tracking Animation
- The eyes rotate based on cursor position
- Uses `mousemove` events and trigonometry (`Math.atan2`)
- Creates a natural pupil-following effect
- Fully custom logic (no external plugin)

This feature is implemented purely with **React state + JavaScript math**, making it a strong example of creative frontend logic.

---

## ⚠️ Responsiveness Notice

> ❗ **This project is NOT responsive.**

- Designed primarily for **desktop screens**
- Focused on animation, scroll experience, and interaction
- Mobile and tablet layouts are not optimized
